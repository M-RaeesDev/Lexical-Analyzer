# ðŸ”Ž JavaScript Lexer Project

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project is a simple **JavaScript Lexer (Lexical Analyzer)** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It scans the input JavaScript code and breaks it into **tokens** (small meaningful units).

ðŸ‘‰ In real-world compilers and tools (like **VS Code, Babel, TypeScript Compiler**), a **Lexer is the first phase of the compiler**.  
It runs **before parsing** and converts raw source code into tokens which are then used for syntax analysis and highlighting.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Converts code into tokens such as:
  - **Keywords** (e.g., `let`, `function`)
  - **Identifiers** (e.g., variable names)
  - **Numbers** (e.g., `123`, `45.6`)
  - **Strings** (e.g., `"Hello"`)
  - **Operators** (e.g., `+`, `==`, `=`)
  - **Separators** (e.g., `;`, `{`, `}`)
- Clear button to reset input and output.
- Very simple and easy-to-use interface.
